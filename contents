The root directory of AROS contains this:

_gdbinit - Init file for the GNU Debugger gdb.

aclocal.m4 - Local macros for GNU autoconf.

bin/ - This directory contains all generated files under the name of
	your OS (eg. \filename{AROS/bin/linux/}). This directory is called
	\shell{$(ARCHDIR)}. Below this are two more directories:
	\shell{$(BINDIR)} where the files should be put which the end user
	should see and \shell{$(GENDIR)} where you can create a directory
	to put all files one part of AROS needs (eg. \filename{libs/} or
	\filename{os/}). The directory \shell{$(OSGENDIR)} is below
	\shell{$(GENDIR)} and all \filename{*.o} files in this directory
	are collected to the \filename{AmigaOS.lib}.

compiler/ - The C compiler for AROS. It contains include files,
	the source for amiga.lib and c.lib and the source for the
	compiler and all compiler specific utilities.

config/ - This directory contains the dirty stuff. Code which makes AROS
	live (mostly hacked up assembler code which you don't want to see).
	Anything is allowed inside this directory in order to make AROS
	work on as many hardwares as possible.

configure - This is a script which examines your system and creates a file
	named \filename{AROS/config/host.cfg} which is used by the makefiles. 
	Run autoconf if it doesn't exist.

configure.in - Source file. Run autoconf to convert this into a configure
	script.

docs/ - The source for the documentation.

license.html - Our copyright license

local/ - This directory and it's contents are ignored by AROS. You can
	put alpha stuff here if you want to avoid CVS complaining about
	it.

make.defaults - File with options for the make. If you want to change
	an option, create a file \filename{make.opts} and put your changes
	there. The most simple method is just to copy \filename{make.defaults}
	to \filename{make.opts}.

make.defaults.in - This file is used by configure to create
	\filename{make.defaults}.

mmake.config - Config file for MetaMake

mmake.config.in - This file is used by configure to create 
	\filename{mmake.config}.

mmakefile - This is the magic file which holds the whole thing together.
	It has the following rules:

	\filtermakefile{$(TOP)/mmakefile,target}

rom/ - Things which are internal parts of the OS.

scripts/ - Scripts which are used to generate code.

test/ - Testsuite for AROS.

tools/ - This contains build tools.

workbench/ - The disk-based part of AROS.
