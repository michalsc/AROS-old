assign DEVS: devs -> ok
list devs: -> ok 
list devs:nil.handler -> "List: Object is of wrong type" 
The problem was that list treated files as directories.

Workbench:> echo > test "Test"
Couldn't run command: Object not found
Workbench:> echo Test
Test
Workbench:>
The problem was the space between ">" and "test". ReadItem() would now
return "" for the filename and "test" as another parameter. Now I simply
skip the ">" or "<" before I allow ReadItem() to process the filename.

exec.library/RemTail() crashes on an empty list. It should return NULL.
I wouldn't be too surprised if RemHead() crashes, too. ('Crash' means:
Segmentation fault.)
The problem was that GetTail() didn't return NULL for an empty list.

BUG000004 fixed
klaus21@t-online.de
The DosList structure found in AROS:include/dos/dosextens.h isn't
compatible to the original (Amiga) one. The biggest problem: dol_Name is a
STRPTR, but it should be a BSTR. (I wrote a program to show the currently
mounted devices, and it took me some time to find out why I got those silly
segfaults. BTW, the first DosList-entry has the name "(Null)", is this the
list-head or does it have any special meaning (i.e., is it a real device?)
dol_Name is now called dol_OldName and is still a BSTR. Additionally there is
now a field called dol_DevName, which is an ordinary STRPTR.

forkbomb cannot be called from the shell (one has to cut&paste one of

BUG000009 partial fix
digulla@aros.fh-konstanz.de
demowin doesn't refresh correctly anymore since Moria3D bug has been
fixed. The initial REFRESH is not sent to the window.

It refreshes now more or less correctly but it sometimes hangs until one
moves the mouse :-/

This will be fixed as soon as the X Graphics HIDD is available.
Maybe connected to BUG000010.

BUG000013 fixed

Moria3D segfaults with a fp exception while "Loading Fading..." on an
Intel (compatible) processors with internal FPU.
This is because you can't operate on floats anymore, maybe FPU has been
disabled.

BUG000014
klaus21@t-online.de
"dir :" does nothing.
The problem is that DoName() does not support a lock to the root directory of
a device. This is due to the fact that this functionality is missing in the
filehandler system.

BUG000015 fixed
digulla@fh-konstanz.de
After rtdemo, dir doesn't work anymore. I get "Object not found".
Changing dirs or using assigns causes segfaults. However, this only affects
the hd filesystem, you can change to RAM: where everything works okay.

Location of the bug:
The line file = Open("test.rtdemo",...) causes the error in the long run
because when removing this line verything seems to work alright.

BUG000016 fixed
digulla@fh-konstanz.de
The path of the inital shell is wrong. Instead of "Workbench:" it

BUG000022
bergers@aros.org
After Demos/listfonts the next entry to the shell will cause a Segmentation 
Fault. The output of listfonts looks like garbage at some lines.

"I think that I found the error in the listfonts program. It is occuring in
ScanFontInfo (af_scanfontinfo.c) in line 74 at the call to CallHookPkt() if
idx=1, because if you put
if (1 == idx)
  return TRUE;
before that line everything works out alright and you'll be able to enter
commands to the shell. But if you put these two lines after the call to
CallHookPkt() you'll get the segmentation fault. Unfortunately I don't know
which code is executed by the call to CallHookPkt()."

The prompt of the shell does not show the complete path anymore, it just
shows the last subdirectory of the path (ie. "Workbench:Locale/Countries"

Maybe related to BUG000016.

BUG000025 fixed

Seek() does not work properly: The position of the file only changes
to the new one if the current position is on EOF.
This was caused by not flushing the filehandle before doing the seek.

There are race conditions between the intuition input handler
and CloseWindow(). When the closebutton is hit many times
fast, it segfaults. This has been "solved" using some flags
(EWFLG_DELAYCLOSE and EWFLG_CLOSEWINDOW), but it should be
redone using semaphores

Fixed: CloseWindow() now sends a message to intuition, that does
the actual closing of the window, thus no race conditions occur.
Downside is that it will slow down the inputhandler, but I think
it is not a big problem.

BUG000043 fixed
nlorentz@online.no
fish/fiveinline hangs when trying to drag the window.
It hangs inside the dragbar class when it tries to lock all layers.
That means somewhere (probably inside graphics_driver) there
is a LockLayer() call without a matching UnlockLayer().
I think the graphics_driver functions that need locking should
maybe be reworked so they have only one exitpont (ie. return),
thus reducing the risk for such bugs, and it would also make
them less difficult to understand.

only the one that was opened latest gets correct input events.

Games/Mine resizes the window. The old windowborder doesn't get erased,

BUG000046 fixed
bergers@aros.org
When starting more than one "mxgads" by "run mxgads" and when letting the
windows stack on top of each other the new window looses its display.

The bug was a coordinate manupilation error
in driver_EraseRect().

BUG000047 fixed
bergers@aros.org
The window in "window" sometimes jumps when calling ChangeWindowBox() for
the first time. When it doesn't jump you cannot close the window with the
gadget. The gadget is assumed to be at the place where it would be if the
window had "jumped".

The problem was that ChangeWindowBox() was not deffered, so there
was a race condition between the app and input.device.


BUG000048 fixed
bergers@aros.org
When the window is enlarged via ChangeWindowBox() the enlarged area is not
cleared, it's black.
I assume that this error is the same one as BUG000046.
The error was that the old window frame was not erased when the window
became larger.

Running multiple "Demos/window"s at the same time leads to flickering on the
whole screen.

BUG000050 fixed
nlorentz@online.no
Running "window" several times after each other causes a severe
memory leak, not inside AROS itself, but in Linux
(Ie. "ps aux"). This is most probably a memoryleak
in x11gfx.hidd: Somewhere XGetImage() is called,
but XFreeImage() or similar is not called.

BUG000051
nlorentz@online.no
Events sometimes come "too late" from X.
Ie, for example when you start a program in arosshell, you have
to press enter several times before the prograp
starts, and then all the keypresses comes from X11 at once.
This is indirectly caused by input.device's timer
(If the timer disabled, it will work normally).
Probably the timer somehow effects unixio HIDD.

'Run' fish/worldtime twice. When the two programs update their display,
the strings are only partially displayed in their correct colors (for

BUG000057 fixed (somewhat)
bergers@aros.org
Demos/filereq is a simple refreshed (is this the reason ??) window and has a 
few problems. The slider bar is incorrectly drawn, no reaction on pushed
buttons etc.

The button problem is fixed. The problem was that the listview
was to large thus overlapping the buttons. Since the listview
came before the buttons in the gadgetlist, the listview
was selected, not the buttons.
