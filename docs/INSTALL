Basic Installation of AROS-SOURCES
----------------------------------

1. Get the source tree.

	As you can read this text, I assume that you already have the
	sources from the CVS server, AmiNet or the AROS FTP server.

	To obtain a recent version via cvs, do a "cvs update -d -P", so
	you get all new files and directories.

	Locations are:

	* CVS - Bleeding edge
	:pserver:username@cvs.aros.org/home/cvs/aros

	* AmiNet - Stable releases
	misc/emu

	* AROS FTP - All releases
	ftp://ftp.aros.org/


2. Install the tree, say in "/usr/src" or anything apropriate.

	It is possible to build AROS in your main cvs-copy, as all
	generated files should be ignored by the CVS server, but I think
	it is better to leave your copy clean, if you can afford the disk
	space. A complete compilation has over 6000 files (inodes) and
	approx. 50 MegaByte for -O2 optimized binaries!


3. Make sure you have all the necessary tools for compilation.

	I.e. a c-compiler (gcc/egcs recommended), binutils, gawk, etc.


4. Run "autoconf".

	This generates the configure script from configure.in.


5. Run "./configure" with possible options:

	* '--enable-gfxhidd' / '--disable-gfxhidd'
	  This determines whether you want to enable gfx via the
	  graphics.hidd or old direct X11 calls.

	  '--enable-gfxhidd' is the default. This value will be
	  cached and can be overridden at any time running
	  configure again with the new option (this will require
	  to recompile major parts of AROS, though).

	* Supported targets

	  On Linux or FreeBSD PC's the default is an emulation
	  environment based on top of Linux/FreeBSD and X11

	  additional target:

	  	--target=native-i386

	  AROS bootable from floppy disk.


	Use "./configure --help" for all possible options.


6. Configure make.opts

	AROS/make.defaults contains the default values for compilation.
	Copy this file to AROS/make.opts and edit it to your needs.
	Options are documented in the default file.

	If you want to create target=native-i386 , then you must set
	all SHARED_* options to "no".


7. Compile your sources.

	Call the wrapper Makefile with 'make'


8. Install the package.

	If you compiled AROS as an emulation then all binaries are placed
	in AROS/bin/$(os)-$(cpu)/AROS. To start AROS 'cd' into this dir,
	type 'aros' and enjoy!

	If you compiled AROS as stand alone (native), then do a
	'make install' to write the boot image to a floppy disk.
	Then leave the disk in /dev/fd0 (Drive A:) and reboot your
	machine and enjoy!
