Basic Installation of AROS-SOURCES
----------------------------------

1. Get the source tree.

	At the moment you have to be an AROS-developer to get the sources
	due to our status with Amiga Inc., which says that we must have a
	licence.
	As you can read this text, I assume that you already have the
	sources from the CVS server.
	To obtain a recent version, do a "cvs update -d", so you get all
	new files and directories.


2. Install the tree, say in "/usr/src" or anything apropriate.

	It is possible to build AROS in your main cvs-copy, as all
	generated files should be ignored by the CVS server, but I think
	it is better to leave your copy clean, if you can afford the disk
	space. A complete compilation has over 6000 files and ~50MB
	for -O2 optimized binaries!


3. Make sure you have all the necessary tools for compilation.

	i.e. a c-compiler (gcc/egcs recommended), binutils, gawk, etc.


4. Run "autoconf".

	This generates the configure script from configure.in.


5. Run "./configure" with possible options:

	* '--enable-gfxhidd' / '--disable-gfxhidd'
	  This determines whether you want to enable gfx via the
	  graphics.hidd or old direct X11 calls.

	  '--enable-gfxhidd' is the default. This value will be
	  cached and can be overridden at any time running
	  configure again with the new option (this will require
	  to recompile major parts of AROS, though).

	* Supported targets

	  On Linux or FreeBSD PC's the default is an emulation
	  environment based on top of Linux/FreeBSD and X11

	  additional target:
	  '--target=native-i386'
	  AROS bootable from floppy disk


	Use "./configure --help" for all possible options.


5. Compile your sources.

	Call the wrapper Makefile with 'make'


6. Install the package.

	If you compiled AROS as an emulation then all binaries are placed
	in AROS/bin/$(os)-$(cpu)/AROS. To start AROS 'cd' into this dir,
	start arosshell and enjoy!

	If you compiled AROS as stand alone (native), then do a
	'make install' to write the boot image to a floppy disk.
	Then leave the disk in /dev/fd0 (Drive A:) and reboot your
	machine and enjoy!
