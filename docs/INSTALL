Basic Installation of AROS-SOURCES
----------------------------------

1. Get the source tree.
	At the moment you have to be an AROS-developer to get the sources
	due to our status with Amiga Inc., which says that we must have a
	licence.
	As you can read this text, I assume that you already have the
	sources from the CVS server.
	To obtain a recent version, do a "cvs update -d", so you get all
	new files and directories.

2. Install the tree, say in "/usr/src" or anything apropriate.
	It is possible to build AROS in your main cvs-copy, as all
	generated files should be ignored by the CVS server, but I think
	it is better to leave your copy clean, if you can afford the disk
	space. A complete compilation has over 6000 files and ~50MB
	for -O2 optimized binaries!

3. Build all the necessary tools for compilation.
	Get all non-AROS tools,
	i.e. get a c-compiler (gcc recommended), binutils, gawk, etc.
	Now compile AROS' tools.
	Run "autogen.sh" with possible options as mentioned below.

	* '--enable-gfxhidd' / '--disable-gfxhidd'
	  This determines whether you want to enable gfx via the
	  graphics.hidd or old direct X11 calls.

	  '--enable-gfxhidd' is the default. This value will be
	  cached and can be overridden at any time running
	  configure again with the new option (this will require
	  to recompile major parts of AROS, though).

	Use "./configure --help" for all possible options.


	We're heading for "autoconf ; configure ; make" builds, but
	right now some other things have to be initialized.

	That's it. And now for the most important step:

5. Compile your sources.
	Call the wrapper Makefile with 'make' or
	if you have the .mmake.config in your $HOME dir, and adjusted
	the "top" variable in it, just call mmake.

Now everything should compile well, and your binaries are placed in
AROS/bin/(os)-(cpu-type)/AROS.
If you have compiled AROS as an emulation, cd into this dir, start
arosshell and enjoy!
