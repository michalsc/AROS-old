Basic Installation of AROS-SOURCES
----------------------------------

1. Get the source tree.

	As you can read this text, I assume that you already have the
	sources from the CVS server, AmiNet or the AROS FTP server.

	To obtain a recent version via cvs, do a "cvs update -d -P",
	so you get all new files and directories.

	Locations are:

	* CVS - Bleeding edge
	:pserver:username@cvs.aros.org/home/cvs/aros

	* AmiNet - Stable releases
	misc/emu

	* AROS FTP - All releases
	ftp://ftp.aros.org/


2. Install the tree, say in "/usr/src" or anything apropriate.

	It is possible to build AROS in your main cvs-copy, as all
	generated files should be ignored by the CVS server, but I
	think it is better to leave your copy clean, if you can afford
	the disk space.  A complete compilation has over 6000 files
	(inodes) and approx. 50 MegaByte for -O2 optimized binaries!


3. Make sure you have all the necessary tools for compilation.

	I.e. a c-compiler (gcc/egcs recommended), binutils, gawk, etc.


4. Run "autoconf".

	This generates the configure script from configure.in.


5. Run "./configure" with possible options:

	* '--with-resolution=XRESxYRES'
	  This is the resolution of the initial Workbench Screen.
	  The default resolution is 800x600 for X11 and 640x480
	  for native-i386 (std. VGA resolution).  This value will
	  be cached.

	* Supported targets

	  On Linux or FreeBSD PC's the default is an emulation
	  environment based on top of Linux/FreeBSD and X11

	  additional target:

	  	--target=native-i386

	  AROS bootable from floppy disk.


	Use "./configure --help" for all possible options.


6. Configure make.opts

	AROS/make.defaults contains the default values for compilation.
	Copy this file to AROS/make.opts and edit it to your needs.
	Options are documented in the default file.

	target=native-i386 requires all SHARED_* options to set to "no".
	This will be done automatically in AROS/make.defaults, don't
	change it.


7. Compile your sources.

	Call the wrapper Makefile with 'make'


8. Install the package.

	If you compiled AROS as an emulation then all binaries are
	placed in AROS/bin/$(os)-$(cpu)/AROS. To start AROS 'cd' into
	this dir, type 'aros' and enjoy!

	If you compiled AROS as stand alone (native), then do a
	'make install' to write the boot image to a floppy disk.
	Then leave the disk in /dev/fd0 (Drive A:), reboot your
	machine and enjoy!
