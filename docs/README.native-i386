This directory only contains this README and the file Image. Copy
Image to a disk using a raw-write program, eg.

    Linux: dd if=Image of=/dev/fd0

    Amiga: copy Image flat:df0

or some other means, put the floppy in a IBM compatible PC and boot
off it. You will see some startup messages and eventually a prompt.
You won't be able to do much at this point (except typing some rom-wack
commands) because this is just a proof of technology (= showing that
it is possible).
