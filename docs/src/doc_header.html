There is a new support page for <A HREF="http://free.polbox.pl/a/arosppc/">AROS
for PPC Amiga</A>.  It will be the main contact page for people interested in
AROS on PPC cards on Amiga hardware and especially those people who are
interested in <STRONG>supporting</STRONG> this by <STRONG>working</STRONG> on
it.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>18.2.2000</TD><TD>
The partnership between the Open Amiga Foundation and AROS is now official (<A
HREF="http://www.openamiga.org/">Read the press release</A>). OAF will handle
the public side (handle publicity) while AROS will concentrate all its energies
on development.<P>

To avoid infringing patents, the menu code for AROS has been changed.  Menus
now look more modern plus they open under the mouse (like a context menu). For
the desperate, the old look is still available :-)<P>

Also, Michael Schulz has committed a big chunk of code for AROS i386/native.
There is now a VGA.HIDD, AROS can open a workbench screen. There are still some
bugs to be ruled out, but it looks <STRONG>very</STRONG> promising.<P>

Lastly for today, Stefan Berger has committed about 20 new applications from
fish disks (cfn, aroach, windowtool, touch, shuffle, memomaster, memeter,
lyr-o-mat, gooddouble, eval, egypt and memsnap). Some still don't do something
useful but they show that porting apps to AROS is really simple.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>15.2.2000</TD><TD>
A longstanding bug with the dates in the ToC has been fixed (it's not
perfect but better than before).
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>12.2.2000</TD><TD>
The autodocs are now <A HREF="autodocs/index.html">here</A>.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>11.2.2000</TD><TD>
We have begun to move contributed software (for example, examples from
Fish disks and Aminet, the small and big games) outside of AROS.
These things have now their own graph (that's why the size of AROS
became smaller last week) and the code is in <TT>AROS-contrib</TT>.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>8.2.2000</TD><TD>
There is progress on the AROS i386/native front. A very basic VGA.HIDD
has been written plus some additional stuff (timer, trackdisk, etc).
