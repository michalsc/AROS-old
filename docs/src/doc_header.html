<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>19.11.2000</TD><TD>
Joerg Dietrich committed a ppm.datatype (for PPM pictures).
Tobias Seiler fixed a long standing bug in the keyboard initialization
of AROS Native/i386, so PS/2 keyboards should work now.
Georg Steger ported more and more programs which use Reqtools and
fixed a lot of bugs in the code. The port of Reqtools should be
finished, soon.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>18.11.2000</TD><TD>
Bugfixes in reqtools.library and Intuition by Georg Steger while 
Johan Alfredsson worked in more DOS commands (Info, Status, Execute)
and fixed a lot of bugs in the dos.library.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>14.11.2000</TD><TD>
Georg Steger finished gadtools.library. Cool Work ! He also fixed some
bugs in the graphics.library-to-HIDD driver. On the following day, he
fixed bugs and committed new code for the C library while Johan Alfredsson
cleaned the dos.library. Again one day later, Georg committed the first
version of a port of reqtools.library and fixed some bugs in the 
workbench.library.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>11.11.2000</TD><TD>
Johan Alfredsson finished his nonvolatile.library and C:Which. Two days
later, he fixed some more Amiga Shell commands and internals.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>8.11.2000</TD><TD>
Georg Steger committed rewritten routines for the DOS functions
MatchFirst(), MatchNext() and MatchEnd(). These should work in all
cases, now. This fixes all those pety bugs like <TT>List C:</TT>.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>6.11.2000</TD><TD>
Joerg Dietrich committed dtdesc, a tool to create and examine DataType
descriptors. Georg Steger improved the building of the FTXT Datatype with
it. Later that day, Joerg backported our binary.datatype to AmigaOS 3.5.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>5.11.2000</TD><TD>
Johan Alfredsson commited a first version of a nonvolatile.library
and nvdisk.library..
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>3.11.2000</TD><TD>
Johan Alfredsson ported the C:Search utility written by Neil Cafferkey
to AROS. Georg Steger renamed our OO Routines into something more
easily distinguishable from BOOPSI (our OO system also used DoMethod(), etc.
which could cause confusions).
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>18.10.2000</TD><TD>
AROS runs on Bochs now, if a bit slow. Georg Steger, who fixed the
last bugs, added a README.Bochs how to make it work. Right now,
he's trying to make AROS work with plex86.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>11.10.2000</TD><TD>
Cleanup of the AROS source tree by Bernardo Innocenti, primitive
hardfile support of FFS-formatted floppy disks (ADF) by Georg
Steger and better mouse support for AROS Native/x86 by Tobias Seiler
(mouse buttons work now). Georg threw in some additional code to
change the position of the mouse pointer on the screen and now
you can move the window around. Since VGA.HIDD doesn't support
the XOR drawing mode, yet, there is still some garbage when you
move the window but that should be fixed, soon :-)
