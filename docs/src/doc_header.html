Over 2000 games have been ported to AROS, yesterday: 
<A HREF="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</A> now runs on AROS :-) Have a look 
yourself at our
<A HREF="http://www.aros.org/screenshots/">screenshots page</A>.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>7.3.2000</TD><TD>
There is now a mailing list for announcements only (basically the same you
can read here :-) Follow 
<A HREF="http://www.aros.org/mailman/listinfo/aros-announce">this link to
subscribe</A>.<P>

Also, the sources for Scalos V2 have been handed over to AROS. Jörg
is lacking the time to give Scalos the attention it deserves and
therefore allowed us to include his work into our contrib area.
No official representative for this work has been elected, yet,
so this is your chance to contribute.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>1.3.2000</TD><TD>
There are still problems to build AROS Native/i386 with EGCS (GCC 2.95.2) which
should be resolved, soon. Some more <A
HREF="screenshots/index.html">screenshots</A> have been added. It's DOOM, this
time. Unlike other Amiga ports of DOOM, DOOM can be run several times on AROS
and you can even play multiplayer games on one machine (not very useful,
though: The keyboard is just too small for four players :-).
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>24.2.2000</TD><TD>
Five new screenshots have been added to
<A HREF="screenshots/index.html">the screenshots section</A> and
(finally), AROS Native/i386 builds again :-) Get your still hot
copy <A HREF="ftp://ftp.aros.org/pub/aros/snapshots">from our
snapshot directory</A>.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>21.2.2000</TD><TD>
There is a new support page for <A HREF="http://free.polbox.pl/a/arosppc/">AROS
for PPC Amiga</A>.  It will be the main contact page for people interested in
AROS on PPC cards on Amiga hardware and especially those people who are
interested in <STRONG>supporting</STRONG> this by <STRONG>working</STRONG> on
it.
