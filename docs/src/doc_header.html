<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>15.2.2000</TD><TD>
A longstanding bug with the dates in the ToC has been fixed (it's not
perfect but better than before).
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>12.2.2000</TD><TD>
The autodocs are now <A HREF="autodocs/index.html">here</A>.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>11.2.2000</TD><TD>
We have begun to move contributed software (for example, examples from
Fish disks and Aminet, the small and big games) outside of AROS.
These things have now their own graph (that's why the size of AROS
became smaller last week) and the code is in <TT>AROS-contrib</TT>.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>8.2.2000</TD><TD>
There is progress on the AROS i386/native front. A very basic VGA.HIDD
has been written plus some additional stuff (timer, trackdisk, etc).
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>7.2.2000</TD><TD>
Code for Menus has been comitted. Unlike on the Amiga, Menus are handled
by a normal task which gets all input events as long as the user presses
the right mousebutton. Therefore, menus don't block, they are very easily
enhanced and the input handler is much more simple. And if blocking menus
ever become an issue, this can added on a per-program basis by looking for
RMB down/up.
