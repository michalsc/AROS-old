Some new software is ported to AROS: The freetype library
(<A HREF="http://www.freetype.org">www.freetype.org</A>),
BGUI and SnoopDOS. Also DOpus becomes more and more usable.
Many bugs in the Gfx.HIDD were fixed and there is now a
quite usable cybergrafx.library. Also the first version
of an IDE driver for x86/Native was committed. Also
a trackdisk.device is there, so we can start porting
a filesystem to AROS.<P>

As for BGUI, we would like someone who will keep it alive on
Amiga (that is, make sure that our changes don't make BGUI
unusable on the Amiga). If you want to help, please contact
<A HREF="mailto:digulla@aros.org">digulla@aros.org</A>.<P>

Also please note that my PGP-key has changed (2048bit instead
of only 1024bit for better security :-). You find my new version
<A HREF="pubkey.asc">here</A> (Shift-Click on the link to download).<P>

Lastly, my Amiga SDK has arrived. You can expect an AROS Amie/Native
but probably not soon.<P>

<I>Note: This is an old announcement which I fogot to copy on the
WWW site. Sorry for that :-(</I><P>

There was no status update for more than 6 weeks (which is too much).
I'll do better in the future :-) In the last few days, our WWW counter
silently skipped 33.333 hits.<P>

The Sowatec AG has decided to give AROS a chance. Several people who
applied for the job to work on AROS have been contacted to arrange for
job interviews. That means for me that I will finally be able to meet
some of the people I worked with for the last five years ;-) It doesn't
mean that there will be an AROS development team in Switzerland, though.
So don't hope for too much, yet :-)<P>

Unfortunately, the date for the World of Alternatives is very unlucky
for me; I'll return from my holidays on Saturday and therefore, I'll
not be able to attend :-( Since the World of Amiga in Cologne seems
to be a dead event this year (Who's left to attend ? Who is willing
to attend ??) I'll try to make it the London Amiga show or whatever
is held this or early next year. Sorry if you did expect me to show
up :-)<P>

On a more happy news, BGUI has been handed over to us and integrated
into AROS (you can download the contrib sources for your copy). Manuel
Lemus promised me that it compiles on Amiga but, unfortunately, it
doesn't compile on AROS, yet (the old lack-of-manpower problem). There
should be no major problems, though and porting has started. I just
can't say when it will be finished. Anyone wanting to work on BGUI
only (and not on AROS) should still apply for a CVS account to
synchronise his work with ours.<P>

Also, Steve Crietzman of the Open Amiga Foundation seems to be pretty
far with finding out which legal obstacles could hurt AROS/Lite. His
effort is currently blocked by the effort of the Sowatec AG to found
an AROS development team (we'll have to sort our legal obstacles first).
As usual, the legal dept. drains all the energies ;-)<P>

On the AROS side, work is still progressing, maybe even at a faster
pace than usual ;-) The AROS Native/i386 flavour is currently broken
(the HIDD system has been greatly enhanced and Michael Schulz currently
cannot take care of it) but AROS Linux/i386 works quite fine. Nils
has committed a couple of patches which greatly enhance the speed of
the graphics output (it's now *much* faster then on the WoA in Cologne
last year in November). Right now, bugs in the build system and exec
are hunted by various AROS developers and I hope to see lots of progress
in that area when I return from my holidays.<P>

As for the survey which I started months ago, I hope I can summarize
them after the holidays :-)<P>

First of all, there are no news regarding the commercial venture
which I spoke about last time. Several ideas are currently weighted
against each other and, as usual when money comes into play, things
progress very slowly. In the mean time, AROS itself progresses at
its usual slow pace :-)<P>

As for job appliances, we need five people and only three persons
which we can use, applied, yet. So there are still two, high payed
jobs open.<P>

Currently, we use DOpus 4, kindly made available to the Amiga community
by GP Software, to find and fix bugs in AROS.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>5.4.2000</TD><TD>
More than two weeks since the last update. No, we're not dead :-) Work 
is still progressing; for example there is now a port of DOpus 4 (see our
<A HREF="http://www.aros.org/screenshots/">screenshots page</A>). Many things
still don't work but it has been ported in just a couple of hours of
work (mostly disabling things in DOpus that AROS doesn't support, yet).
Promising, I'd say.<P>

But the more important news is that we finally got the attention of Amiga
(mostly because of the efforts of Steve Crietzman of OAF and Gary Peake
of Amiga; thanks a lot guys). I'd like to say that's good news but that's
not completely clear, yet. The point is that Amiga would like to help us
but their lawyers object :-) Welcome to the wonderful world of business.
Currently, we're trying to find a way thought his legal mess which a)
doesn't hurt Amie, b) gives AROS room to breathe, c) makes Amigas lawyers
happy and d) helps the community. c) seems to be the most problematic
point here but we're working on it. Some very interesting ideas have been
proposed and now we and Amiga are checking what can be done and what is
futile. At this time, just a big thank at Amiga for their openmindedness
and the time they spent on this during the last three weeks when they
were also really busy with preparing everything for the Amiga 2K show.
Just in case you wonder why nothing was announced after fleecys' comment
in the IRC conference: The lawyers covered Bill with Red Tape when they
wanted to do the announcement. So you have to take my word for it :-)
Hopefully, you can read something in the Executive Summary, soon. No
promises, though; this is really ugly and every lawyer asked until now
strongly suggested to proceed with extreme care. Oh well...<P>

Something on the more positive front, whatever happenes, the AROS sources
will stay available at least under MPL. Also, 4 people already applied for
working on AROS. Unfortunately, only one of them can move to Switzerland
and that especially unfortunate as my boss has come up with some plans
to get this thing going. So please, if you can imagine working on this
full time, send your curriculum, etc. to
<A HREF="mailto:yourievsky@sowatec.com">yourievsky@sowatec.com</A>. As a
teaser: You will earn at least Sfr 72.000/year (that's about 45.000 Euros)
because otherwise, the Swiss Foreignpolice will not allow you to move
to Switzerland (basically, the idea is that if we don't need highly
trained specialists for that job, we should be able to find someone
native for that; good for you in this case). Additional bonus: If this
project fails, we can easily find something else for you to do. So no
matter what happens, you can rely on having a job :-)<P>

There is now a <A HREF="votes.html">summary of votes</A> on this
server which I will update once per day. Please continue voting.
Since there seems to be a confusion how the polling works: My
script looks for the questions and then for a digit and counts
that.

Unnoticed, our WWW site has passed 20'000 hits this weekend :-)<P>

<A HREF="http://amiga.eden.it/">AmiWorld On-Line</A> has translated versions
of their AROS article. There is now a german, an english, an italian
and even a japanese version ! Follow
<A HREF="http://amiga.eden.it/index_e.html">this link</A> to the index
of all articles.<P>

We are currently doing a poll on options. Please read
