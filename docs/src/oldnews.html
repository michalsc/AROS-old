AROS will become the development wing of OAF, the Open Amiga Foundation
(what COSA will become). OAF will handle public relations and the contact
to Amiga, they will collect and compile all information and keep us
informed about all important events so that we can completely concentrate
on the development. They will also handle all money and legal issues which
is a very big releaf for us.

We are currently working on Intuition (fixing bugs, integrating things better,
making menus work), the hardware drivers for AROS Native/x86 (vga.hidd
and scsi.device/hidd), commodities, datatypes and AROS Native/PPC. 
Especially for the last one, we need more people who know about
WarpUp and PowerUp. Also, people who know how to write hardware
drivers for a PC (namely how to make Exec handle PCs' IRQs and
a driver for the IDE chips) are needed.

Recent speed tests show that we have reached about 80% of the native
hardware speed (Quake at 320x200 runs at 60FPS with Linux/X11 and
at 50FPS with AROS on Linux/x86). So our speed problems with graphics
seem finally resolved. Also the links and the status section have been
updated.

There are two good articles about AROS on the net. The first one is
<A HREF="http://elwoodb.free.fr/AROS">here</A> (it's an interview
with Aaron Digulla) and the other one is
<A HREF="http://amiga.eden.it/dossier/aros/aros_eng.html">here</A>
(background and some detail info on AROS). This article is a bit
older but it's written very well (and it's also available in
<A HREF="http://amiga.eden.it/dossier/aros/aros.html">italian</A>).
