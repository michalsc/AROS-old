[this readme last updated 990106]

This version of amiboot takes two extra (optional) arguments:

 --apus:     Use this when you want to boot a PPC kernel.
 --checksum: Use this to perform checksums on the kernel image before and
             after copying it to its final location. This will increase
             startup time by 15 secs or so.

I use this rune to boot my PPC kernel:

 bootstrap --apus -k ram:vmlinux root=/dev/hda3 ip=off


Whatever extra options you need, always make sure to put the bootstrap
options first (the ones starting with '-') and the kernel options last.

If you experience problems with the Linux/APUS port, please have a look at
the Linux/APUS FAQ available via http (and ftp) from sunsite.auc.dk:
http://sunsite.auc.dk:local/os/linux/apus/docs/faq.html

The booter also stores a progress string in memory. You can use the tool
bootmesg (included in the archive) to find this after rebooting. See the FAQ
for details.


If that does not help you, post a message to the Linux/APUS kernel list also
hosted by sunsite. See the FAQ for details.

Recompiling the apus booter:

 o get Geek Gadgets
 o get linux-2.1.42
 o put the source files from this archive in the arch/m68k/boot/amiga
   directory.
 o edit include/linux/types.h: define #__KERNEL_STRICT_NAMES and out
                               comment the ustat struct.
        include/linux/posix-types.h: exchange the two first lines.
 o try to compile (remember to cross your fingers :)

 You can have a look in the script compile which I use to compile bootstrap.
