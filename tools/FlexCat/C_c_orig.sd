/****************************************************************
    This file uses the auto initialization possibilities of
    Dice, gcc and SAS/C, respectively.

    Dice does this by using the keywords __autoinit and
    __autoexit, SAS uses names beginning with _STI or
    _STD, respectively. gcc uses the asm() instruction,
    to emulate C++ constructors and destructors.

    Using this file you don't have *all* possibilities of
    the locale.library. (No Locale or Language arguments are
    supported when opening the catalog. However, these are
    *very* rarely used, so this should be sufficient for most
    applications.
