dtdesc - The DataType Descriptor Tools

Here you have two tools to create and disassemble DataType descriptors.
DataType descriptors are those little files in Devs:DataTypes/ , which
are used by the DataType system to recognice the type of a file.
DataType descriptors are IFF-FORMs of type DTYP.
They contain different chunks. The most important are:

NAME : Name of the DataType, in most cases identical to the filename

FVER : Amiga-version-string (optional)

DTHD : DataTypeHeader The most important chunk.
       Contains a struct DataTypeHeader as descriped in <datatypes/datatypes.h>
       and the strings for this struct.

DTCD : Code-chunk This chunk contains executable code. So you can have
       a function to decide the type of a file.
       Because this is not portable to AROS, it is not supported by dtdesc.

For more informations see the header <datatypes/datatypes.h> .

examinedtdesc is used to disassemble an existing DataType descriptor.
It accepts as its only argument the filename of a DataType descriptor.
And puts out a DataType description named descriptor.dtd .
This DataType description is a ASCII-file, for details see the file FORMAT .

createdtdesc is a tool to create a DataType descriptor.
It accepts as its only argument the filename of a DataType description (*.dtd).
And puts out the DataType descriptor, named after the "Name" keyword inside.
Yes I know my naming convention is a bit confusing, come with better names!
You can feed createdtdesc with the output of examinedtdesc.
