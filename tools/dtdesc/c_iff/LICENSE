Because c_iff might be usefull outside of AROS,
I release it under the

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2.1, February 1999

See the file lesser.txt for details.

This shouldn't be a problem for AROS, because
c_iff is not part of the main-tree.

The utility autodoc.pl is released under the

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2, June 1991

because I use it with other projects too.

See the file gpl.txt for details.
