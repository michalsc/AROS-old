TODO LIST GFX HIDD:

- pass GC to all bitmap rendering calls.
DONE

- Correct handling in AllocBitMap() (BMF_MINPLANES etc)
DONE, but do not check for BMF_MINPLANES; maybe not necessary.

- Implement a temp BM object for planar Amiga bitmaps, to
  avoid cluttering up the graphics_driver.
  

- Implement rendering in bm baseclass only with the help of
pixel format and baseadress.

- Use the above to handle PIXFMT_XXX CGFX bitmaps

- Callback funcs for refresh info and for active window info

- ClipRectangle in the bitmap class. Try to implement
some general HIDD_BM_ApplyClipping() method in
the BM baseclass for ease of use by the subclasses.
The clipping should be used for lines, ellipses etc.
