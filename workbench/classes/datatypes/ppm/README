This is ppm.datatype a simple PPM (Portable PixMap) datatype.
In fact it is a very simple ppm.datatype:

 * It displays only P6 PPMs.
 * The header-parser is a bit limited.
   It supports only the most commonly used form of PPM-headers.
 * The color reducing algorythm produces really ugly results,
   but it is fast and simple.

The sole purpose of this datatype is to help me to develop
picture.datatype. And it can be used as a base for other
picture subdatatypes.
