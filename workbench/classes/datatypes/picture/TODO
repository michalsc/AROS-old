picture.datatype is an external class. So it has only very few
functions: some library-support and the class-dispatcher.
But the methods and properties of the class must be written.
The following items must be implemented:

library-framework               100% done
documentation                   Hey, I am a programmer, not an author ;)
dispatcher-function             80% done, some missing support-functions
				for the methods

methods:                        still missing completely
