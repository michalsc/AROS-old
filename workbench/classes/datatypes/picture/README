This picture.datatype is a work in progress. It compiles cleanly, 
but is far from being complete!
Currently only the library-framework is done (trough copying from
text.datatype ;) ) See the file TODO for a detailed description
of the missing pieces.
Feel free to help me with picure.datatype. But please contact me
before to avoid double work.
One word about style: I do use a strange intention-scheme!
As long as picture.datatype is in development, I will use
my own style, but I will fix this, if it's complete.
