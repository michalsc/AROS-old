Type:      util/dtype
Kurz:      V44.5 des text.datatypes Ersatz
Requires:  OS 3.0
Version:   44.5

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a replacement of the text.datatype. It should be compatible with
the orginal text.datatypes available within the OS. I wrote it because the
orginal text.datatype lacks the support of marking and copying passages.
With this version you also can search through the whole text.

To popup the search requester press return. Use Tab to search forward and
Shift-Tab to search backward.

How to use install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
