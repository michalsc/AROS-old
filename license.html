<DD>     3.1. Application of License. <BR>
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. <BR><BR>

<DD>     <A HREF="annotate.html#11" TARGET="annotations">3.2. Availability of Source Code.</A> <BR>
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available, to the Initial Developer and to the Maintainer; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You are responsible for notifying the Initial Developer and the Maintainer of the Modification and the location of the Source if a contact means is provided. You can contact the Maintainer to make the Modification available. <BR><BR>

<DD>     3.3. Description of Modifications. <BR>
     You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.<BR><BR>

<OL TYPE="a" START="1">
          	<LI><A HREF="annotate.html#12" TARGET="annotations">Third Party Claims.</A>  <BR>
          	If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. <BR><BR>

          	<LI><A HREF="annotate.html#13" TARGET="annotations">Contributor APIs.</A>  <BR>
          	If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file. <BR><BR>
</OL>

<DD>     <A HREF="annotate.html#14" TARGET="annotations">3.5. Required Notices.</A><BR> 
     You must duplicate the notice in <A HREF="#A">Exhibit A</A> in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.<BR><BR>

     However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<BR><BR> 

<DD>     <A HREF="annotate.html#15" TARGET="annotations">3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</A> <BR>
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor.

<DT><A HREF="annotate.html#16" TARGET="annotations">4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.</A> <BR><BR>

<DD>     6.1. New Versions. <BR>

<DD>     <A HREF="annotate.html#18" TARGET="annotations">6.2. Effect of New Versions.</A> <BR>
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the Maintainer. No one other than the Maintainer has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code beyond what is granted under this and subsequent Licenses. <BR><BR>

<DD>     <A HREF="annotate.html#19" TARGET="annotations">6.3. Derivative Works.</A> <BR>
     If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the AROS Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in <A HREF="#A">Exhibit A</A> shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.) <BR><BR>

<DT><A HREF="annotate.html#20" TARGET="annotations">7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</A> <BR><BR>

All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. <BR><BR>

<DT>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. <BR><BR>

     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.

<DT>11. MISCELLANEOUS. <BR><BR>

     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. <BR><BR>

<DT><A HREF="annotate.html#21" TARGET="annotations">12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</A> <BR><BR>

     Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an equitable basis. <BR><BR>

<DT>13. ADDITIONAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO THE AROS PUBLIC LICENSE. <BR><BR>

      Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit the Maintainer from licensing under different terms than this License any code which the Maintainer otherwise would have a right to license. <BR><BR>

     Inability to Comply Due to Contractual Obligation - To the extent that the Maintainer is limited contractually from making third party code available under this License, the Maintainer may choose to integrate such third party code into Covered Code without being required to distribute such third party code in Source Code form, even if such third party code would otherwise be considered "Modifications" under this License. <BR><BR>
