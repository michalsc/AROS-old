alib/ - The source for the amiga.lib. This link library
        contains small utility functions which didn't made it
        into a shared library.

aros/ - The source for aros.lib. This link library
        contains special functions which allow to write
        portable code.

clib/ - The source for AROS' c.lib. This link library
        contains the standard ANSI C (and some more)
        library functions like |printf()|, |strcpy()|, etc.

        The directory also contains the includes for ANSI C.

include/ - This directory contains all AROS specific
        includes as well as all Amiga includes which have
        been modified for AROS. Note that these files are
        searched *before* the files in
        \filename{amiga/include/}. Most people will notice
        this when they compile some program which uses a
        function which has not yet been implemented in
        AROS. The compiler will complain about a function
        without a prototype despite the fact that it is in
        \filename{amiga/include/clib/*_protos.h}. That's
        because it doesn't look there and if you ever get
        an error like this, have a look into include first.
